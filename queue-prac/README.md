This is a 'naive' linear queue. It relies on shifting values to the left (towards index 0) when dequeue() is called. Not an efficient implementation as dequeue() will be O(n).

It is not efficient of course, but it is what I came up with when I first thought of implementing an array queue, so I will leave it here.
