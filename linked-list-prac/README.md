This is a singly linked list. I have added:

Inserting:
	- insert_beg(&list, x)
	- insert_end(&list, x)
	
Removing:
	- rem_beg()
	- rem_end()
	- rem_value(x) -------- TODO!

Searching:
	- search_list(list, x)

Printing:
	- print_list(list)

Free memory:
	- free_list(list)

Make sure to initilize list to null when you make it, otherwise errors pop up.

I will have to make an abstract list data type based on linked list eventually.
