This is a singly linked list. I have added:

Inserting:
 	* insert_beg(&list, x)
	* insert_end(&list, x)
	
Removing:
	* rem_beg(&list)
	* rem_end(&list)
	* rem_value(&list, x)

Searching:
	* search_list(list, x)

Printing:
	* print_list(list)

Free memory:
	* free_list(list)

Make sure to initilize list to null when you make it, otherwise errors pop up.
I will make an abstract list data type based on linked list eventually.
Maybe I should add a remove all of value function too!
