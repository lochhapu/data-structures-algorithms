Here I will try to implement a C string library. The purpose of this is to learn how strings work in C, and to practice string manipulation algorithms. Strings in C are raw and dangerous, and I'd like to get to know them.

Functions:
- `string_length(char *)`: return the length of given string, 0 if NULL.
- `string_equal(char *, char *)`: checks if strings are equal, false if one is NULL, true if both NULL.
