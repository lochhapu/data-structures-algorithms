# Begineer to Intermediate Checklist for Data Structures

## 1. Arrays (C and Python)
[ ] C: Create, access, update, delete elements (using arrays and dynamic arrays)
[ ] C: Traversal, Linear search, Bubble sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort
[ ] Python: Same with lists

## 2. Strings (C and Python)
[ ] C: Length, Reverse, Palindrome, Substring search (naive) - using char arrays
[ ] Python: Same using string methods and without methods (for practice)

## 3. Linked Lists (C and Java)
[ ] C: Singly linked list (all operations), Doubly, Circular (optional)
[ ] Java: Singly and Doubly (using classes)

## 4. Stacks (C and Java)
[ ] C: Array-based and linked list-based, Applications (parentheses, postfix)
[ ] Java: Linked list-based (using classes) and array-based (using arrays)

## 5. Queues (C and Java)
[ ] C: Simple, Circular, Deque (array and linked list)
[ ] Java: Using classes (linked list and array)

## 6. Trees (C and Java)
[ ] C: BST (insert, search, traversals, delete optional)
[ ] Java: BST (object-oriented)

## 7. Hashing (C and Python)
[ ] C: Hash table with separate chaining (linked lists)
[ ] Python: Using dictionaries and also implementing a simple one (optional)

## 8. Recursion & Basic Algorithms (Python and C)
[ ] Python: Factorial, Fibonacci, Towers of Hanoi, Binary search, Merge sort, Quick sort
[ ] C: Binary search, Merge sort, Quick sort (on arrays)

# Learning Plan
This plan covers two languages per topic and avoids overloading with three.

# Intermediate Mastery
Now, the milestone:
[ ] Can implement array list (dynamic array) -> C (using malloc) and Python (list)
[ ] Can implement linked list (singly & doubly) -> C and Java
[ ] Can implement stack & queue (array + linked list) -> C and Java
[ ] Can implement BST (insert, search, traversals) -> C and Java
[ ] Can code and explain binary search -> Python and C
[ ] Can code and explain merge sort & quicksort -> Python and C
[ ] Familiar with hashing and recursion problems -> C and Python

After this, I can dive into more advanced data structures and algorithms, if it is useful to do so.
