# Beginner to Intermediate DSA Checklist

A roadmap to practice Data Structures & Algorithms in C, Python, and Java.  

---

## 1. Arrays (C & Python)  
- [ ] C: Create, access, update, delete (static & dynamic arrays with malloc)  
- [ ] C: Traversal, Linear Search, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort  
- [ ] Python: Same with lists (built-in and manual implementations)  

---

## 2. Strings (C & Python)  
- [ ] C: Length, Reverse, Palindrome, Substring search (naive) using char arrays  
- [ ] Python: Same with string methods and manual implementations  

---

## 3. Linked Lists (C & Java)  
- [ ] C: Singly Linked List (all operations), Doubly, Circular (optional)  
- [ ] Java: Singly and Doubly Linked Lists (using classes)  

---

## 4. Stacks (C & Java)  
- [ ] C: Array-based and Linked List-based stacks  
- [ ] C: Applications (parentheses matching, postfix evaluation)  
- [ ] Java: Stacks with arrays and linked lists  

---

## 5. Queues (C & Java)  
- [ ] C: Simple Queue, Circular Queue, Deque (array + linked list)  
- [ ] Java: Queues with arrays and linked lists  

---

## 6. Trees (C & Java)  
- [ ] C: Binary Search Tree (insert, search, traversals, delete optional)  
- [ ] Java: BST (object-oriented implementation)  

---

## 7. Hashing (C & Python)  
- [ ] C: Hash table with Separate Chaining (linked lists)  
- [ ] Python: Dictionaries (built-in) and custom hash table (optional)  

---

## 8. Recursion & Basic Algorithms (C & Python)  
- [ ] Python: Factorial, Fibonacci, Towers of Hanoi, Binary Search, Merge Sort, Quick Sort  
- [ ] C: Binary Search, Merge Sort, Quick Sort (on arrays)  

---

# Intermediate Mastery Milestones

By completing the above, I should be able to:

- [ ] Implement a Dynamic Array (ArrayList) -> C (malloc) and Python (list)  
- [ ] Implement a Linked List (Singly & Doubly) -> C and Java  
- [ ] Implement a Stack & Queue (Array + Linked List) -> C and Java  
- [ ] Implement a BST (insert, search, traversals) -> C and Java  
- [ ] Code and explain Binary Search -> Python and C  
- [ ] Code and explain Merge Sort & Quick Sort -> Python and C  
- [ ] Understand Hashing and common Recursion problems -> C and Python
