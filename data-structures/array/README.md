# Array

## What is an array?
An array is a linear, contiguous data structure. Arrays can be static or dynamic (aka: vector, arraylist).

## Why arrays
- They are blazing fast: O(1) access!
- Super easy to implement, even built into C syntax.

## The disadvantage
- Dynamic arrays are more complex, they require resizing, copying and shifting of elements. 

## Usage
- If your data has a fixed number of elements, then arrays are a great DS to use.
- If you will costantly add and remove elements, then arrays might not be the best.
