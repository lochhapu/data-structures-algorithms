jjData Structures & Algorithms

Here I’ll be posting my data structure and algorithm implementations.  

Not for production use (yet) — this repo is mainly for practice, reference, and learning.
It might grow into something bigger in the future. I’ll mostly use C and Python, and maybe C++ later for abstract data types. Along the way, I’ll also share my thoughts and (probably less-than-optimal) analysis of what I implement.  

As of now, I am following an begineer -> intermediate  checklist.

## Notes
- This repo is my personal learning log.  
- Code might not always be optimal, but that’s part of the journey.  
- If you stumble across this repo — feel free to explore, suggest, or just watch me improve.
