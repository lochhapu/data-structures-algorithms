# data-structures-algorithms
Here I will post my data structure and algorithm implementations. It's not for production use in anyway (yet), it is just there for my reference and to practice these concepts. It might become something more in the future maybe. I will mostly use C and Python for these, maybe C++ in the future. I will also post my thoughts and less-than-optimal analysis of whatever I've implemented.

Data structures implemented:
  - Queue:
    * Naive linear queue [✅]
    * Proper linear queue [TODO]
    * Circular queue [TODO]
  - Stack:
    * Array stack [✅]
    * Singly linked list stack [TODO]

Will focus on stack and queue for now, linked list coming soon!
