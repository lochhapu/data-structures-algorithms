# data-structures-algorithms
Here I will post my data structure and algorithm implementations. It's not for production use in anyway (yet), it is just there for my reference and to practice these concepts. It might become something more in the future maybe. I will mostly use C and Python for these, maybe C++ in the future for abstract data types. I will also post my thoughts and less-than-optimal analysis of whatever I've implemented.

Data structures implemented:
  - Queue:
    * Naive linear queue [✅]
    * Proper linear queue [TODO]
    * Circular queue [TODO]
  - Stack:
    * Array stack [✅]
    * Singly linked list stack [TODO]
  - Linked list:
    * Singly linked list [✅]

Added these three for now. I don't know if I will try to implement doubly and circular linked lists just yet. I will focus on sorting algorithms after this.
