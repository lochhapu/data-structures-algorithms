# Data Structures & Algorithms

Here I’ll be posting my data structure and algorithm implementations.  

Not for production use (yet) — this repo is mainly for practice, reference, and learning.
It might grow into something bigger in the future. I’ll mostly use C and Python, and maybe C++ later for abstract data types. Along the way, I’ll also share my thoughts and (probably less-than-optimal) analysis of what I implement.

## Implemented / Planned

#### 🔹 Queue
- [x] Naive linear queue
- [ ] Proper linear queue
- [ ] Circular queue

#### 🔹 Stack
- [x] Array stack  
- [ ] Singly linked list stack  

#### 🔹 Linked List
- [x] Singly linked list

*(not sure yet if I’ll go into doubly or circular linked lists)*

## Next Steps
After linked lists, I’ll move on to **sorting algorithms**.

## Notes
- This repo is my personal learning log.  
- Code might not always be optimal, but that’s part of the journey.  
- If you stumble across this repo — feel free to explore, suggest, or just watch me improve.
