# Data Structures & Algorithms

Here I’ll be posting my **data structure** and **algorithm** implementations.  

**Not for production use (yet)** — this repo is mainly for **practice, reference, and learning**.
It might grow into something bigger in the future.  
I’ll mostly use **C** and **Python**, and maybe **C++** later for abstract data types.
Along the way, I’ll also share my thoughts and (probably less-than-optimal 😅) analysis of what I implement.

## ✅ Implemented / Planned

#### 🔹 Queue
- [x] Naive linear queue  
- [ ] Proper linear queue  
- [ ] Circular queue  

#### 🔹 Stack
- [x] Array stack  
- [ ] Singly linked list stack  

#### 🔹 Linked List
- [x] Singly linked list  
  *(not sure yet if I’ll go into doubly or circular linked lists)*

## ⏭️ Next Steps
After linked lists, I’ll move on to **sorting algorithms**.

## Notes 📝
- This repo is my personal **learning log**.  
- Code might not always be “optimal,” but that’s part of the journey.  
- If you stumble across this repo — feel free to explore, suggest, or just watch me improve. 😄
